# TriSpec
Computes the spectrum of infinite periodic tri-diagonal matrices. The input is given in the form of three vectors
representing one period for each diagonal.  
The method is based on discrete Floquet-Bloch theory: the infinite matrix is transformed to a family of finite matrices whose spectra make up the spectrum of the original operator.
